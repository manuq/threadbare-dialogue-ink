* Hi! I'm looking for a way out of this cave.

- You'll need light! The way out is, ironically, going deeper into the mountain.

* I don't have a lantern. What do I do?

- Maybe you could use that yarn you have there.

* I can't use it for fire! This is a special kind of yarn.

- Isn't all yarn special here? Sometimes, you have to give a little to take a little...

* Ok, I'll use this much
* NO! I won't use this yarn
